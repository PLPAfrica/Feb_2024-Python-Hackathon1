# Create a Python program that:


# - Prompts a user to enter their age.
# - Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
# - Prints "You are eligible to vote" if true, otherwise "You are not eligible to vote."
def validate_age():
    age=int(input("Please enter your age: "))
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible for voting")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible for voting")
validate_age()
