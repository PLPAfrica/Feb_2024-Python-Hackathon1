# Create a Python program that:

# - Prompts a user to enter their age.
# - Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
# - Prints "You are eligible to vote" if true, otherwise "You are not eligible to vote."

# Identify user by name and ID_Number
name = str(input("What is your name? "))
id_number = input("What is your ID number? ") # Corrected variable name

# Ask the user's age to determine voting eligibility
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age >= 18:
    # Welcome the user by name and inform about eligibility
    print(f"Welcome, {name}. You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    # Inform the user about ineligibility if age requirement is not met
    print(f"Sorry, {name}. You are not eligible to vote yet.")

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
