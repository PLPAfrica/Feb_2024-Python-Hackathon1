voting_age = 18

# Prompt the user to enter their age
user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check eligibility using an if-else statement
if user_age >= voting_age:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")

# Create a Python program that:


# - Prompts a user to enter their age.
# - Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
# - Prints "You are eligible to vote" if true, otherwise "You are not eligible to vote."
