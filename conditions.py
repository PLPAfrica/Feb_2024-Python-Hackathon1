# Python Conditional Statements 

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
  print("You are eligible to vote")

else:
  print("You are not eligible to vote")

# Create a Python program that:


# - Prompts a user to enter their age.
# - Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
# - Prints "You are eligible to vote" if true, otherwise "You are not eligible to vote."
