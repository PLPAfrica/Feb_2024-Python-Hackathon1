# Create a Python program that:


# - Prompts a user to enter their age.
age = input("Enter your age: ")
# - Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
if int(age) >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are note eligible to vote.")
# - Prints "You are eligible to vote" if true, otherwise "You are not eligible to vote."
