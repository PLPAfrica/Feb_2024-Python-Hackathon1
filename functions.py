# Functions & Fibonacci Sequence
# Question
# Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term n. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.
#We have provided  you with in-complete code, from the Knowledge learned from week 1 to week 3 please complete the missing parts to achieve the goal of the question.
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term n using iteration.

    Args:
        n: The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Returns:
        A list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

    fibonacci_sequence = []  # Initialize the sequence list

# Print the Fibonacci sequence

# Your program should:

# Ask the user to input the value of n.
# Create a function that takes n as a parameter and returns a list containing the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
# Print the generated Fibonacci sequence.
